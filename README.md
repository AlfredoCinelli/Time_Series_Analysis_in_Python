# Introduction_to_Time_Series_Analysis

In the main there are some application of time series concepts applied on stocks log-returns, therefore a testing framework for unit root and stylized facts are 
made. Then univariate mean modelling has been made via ARIMA models, then univariate volatility modelling via GARCH is conducted and eventually a glimpse of multivariate
modelling via VAR is made with some dedicated functions.
